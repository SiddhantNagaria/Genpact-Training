import { Component } from "react";

reactJs

js library = used to built user interface UI
websites, web applications

created by facebook
focuses on UI

uses a component based architecture
means that UI is divided into small reusable blocks

Login FormData, Navbar, Button, Product card - each of these are components

Problem - update UI - reloaded - updation - slow process
        - efficiently update the UI when data changes

React - VDOM - Virtual DOM
            - copy of real DOM
            - react compares old state vs new state
            - only updates the changed parts
            - result - 

React - build fast, dynamic , interactive web pages using reusable component
Dashboards , Chat Apps, Ecommerce product filtering .....

Navbar Header Footers

JSX (Javascript + HTML together)
React allows writing HTML directly inside Javascript using JSX

function firstFunc(){

}

Fb, Instagram, NetFlix, AirBnb...
Large scale applications
Build one - reuse everywhere

charts, maps, UI, State management, animations

React DEV Environment:
Node.js => allows js to run outside the browser
            - tools, compiler run on Node

npm - node package manager
    - install react 
    - manage dependencies
    - run development servers
    - build production Apps

React Apps - Single Page Application - only one HTML file 

App - defined a component

index.html - already defined

index.js => Entry point of your applications
         tell the react to load <app/> component insdie index.html

App.css = specific styling for App.js
index.css = global styling

Run = npm start

Webpack bundles all files
JSX => JS
development server Run
browser load public / index.html
index.js = inject App insdie root element
react render components in the browser

Node = lets run JS code
npm install dependencies
react project structure - organizes entire code
src/ = all coding is development


Functional Component = props
-> props -> FC can receive data as well
No lifecycle

Class components
classes extend from React.Component
can hold state as well as they have lifecycle methods
presentation along with other logic
older style of creating

-> built in lifecycle methods
allows us to run code specific points


LifeCycle Phases-
Mounting phases - initialize state ,fetch API data
                - constructor(), render(), componentDidMount()
Updating phase -> responds to state/ props changes
                - shouldComponentUpdate()
                -ComponentDidUpdate
unmounting Phase - cleanup, remove event listeners
                 - componentWillUnmount()









React Hooks - this is used with functional components
FC with reacr hooks
