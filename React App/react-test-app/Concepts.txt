React Testing with Jest
Jest => Javascript testing framework

- test runner / assertion library
- run Test for React code
pure functions / component interactions/ UI behaviour

Jest -
Test Runner + assertion library + mocking - one package
created by Facebook - React
Features -> quick test runs, test isolation, code coverage generation, watch mode for fast analysis
Integrates easily with Create React App

why test react apps -
Test component - ensure behave as intended
testing serves as executable documentation for expected behaviour
Writing Test -> component responsibilities - public APIs - behave

Types of test -> 
1.Unit Test :
    test small units (tiny components, pure functions, utility modules)
2.Component Test :
    validate component outpout(rendered, classnames, returned JSX) give some props
3.Integration Test :
    Test multiple component together and interactions(child components, hooks)
    Actual rendering, event handling
4. DOM/ Behaviour test :
    Render components into a DOM like environment, query elements, simulate events, assert visible behaviour

Jest works :
->Test discovery : Jest finds files matching patterns : c1.js -> c1.test.js
                 : *.test.js
->isolated environment : each test file runs in its own process to avoid shared state b/w files
Assertions : expect(value)


// integration test :
small Home package
fetch users/users from APIs
App.js 
route -> /users
integration test : navigate, interact with Counter, then navigate to users
//assert that fetched data is shown

//get = hotels list , hotel by id, name
//post = post new hotel
//delete - id 
//put = update hotel 
//localhost : 8080

//react frontend - localhost 3000
//react package.json

//backend = CORS (config class)
