	//SDLC - software development life cycle
/*  Structured process - define stages involved in developing stages
	from idea to deployement and maintenance
	
	systematic approach
	s/w - developed on time, within budget, high quality
	class / objects - class - blueprints
	SDLC - blueprint - development team - plan , build, test and delivering
	
	Designed - meets user requirements
	SDLC - framework
	Phases of the project
	
	1. Requirement analysis - understand requirements - what user wants from application
		- document - SRS = software requirement specification - 5
	
	Online Food Ordering system
	- restaurants, customers
	- menu browsing options , list of restaurant, live order tracking , rating , notification - SRS
	
	2. Feasibility study - check whether the project is doable within constraints
						 - technical , financial, legal
	Check if live tracking is possible MAPs API, payment - securely as well , deadline 
	
	3. System Design / Design Architecture
		- plan how the system will work internally and look externally
		- design db schema, design UI, microservices
		
	4. Coding & Implementation
		- actual coding of software components
		- 
		
	5. Testing and QA (quality assurance)
		- testing -> verify and validate
					- each module be tested and integrated with APIs and servers 
	
	6. Deployment - 
		- make application available to users
		- deploy on client's base or on cloud (AWS, AZURE, GCP)
		- Backend API on any one cloud services and Frontend deployed on Web server
		
	7. Maintenance & Feedback -
		- continuous improvement 
		- fix issues

	WHY SDLC ?
	
	1. Predictability - everyone knows what to do at each phase
	2. Quality Control - Testing is built in, post release fewer issues
	3. Time and Cost Efficiency - Rework - clarified requests - time cost saved
	4. Transparency - SRS - signed docuemnt b/w client and dev org
					- stakeholders can track progress and verify from SRS
	5. Risk Reduction - Identify problems early
	
	SDLC DELIVERABLES -
	
	1. Requirement Analysis - SRS
	2. System Design - system design document (ER) diagram.
	3. Implementation - Source code, build Files
	4. Test Phase - Test cases, test reports
	5. Deployment - release notes, deployment scripts
	6. Maintenance - updates documented , version reports
