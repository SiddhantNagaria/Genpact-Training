Modules

JS file that expors some code so that another file can import and use them

-> java.util -> inbuilt

-> create our own modules

Adv/Imp -> organize your code in separate files
		- reuse functions/classes across various files
		- improves maintainability 
		

MAth.js - mathematical operations can be coded- add(), sqrt()
log.js - logging functions - addLog()

main.js - need to use any of these- import these modules

named exports : way to export value - explicitly export multiple things
default export - only one defauly export per module.
