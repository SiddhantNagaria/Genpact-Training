//Promises - async, fetch, try...catch

//JavaScript - single threaded - it can do only one thing at a time

// many tasks consumes time :
//fetch data from server API calls;
//Reading files
//DB Ops
//large processing

//If JS waited - blocked for all such tasks - browser will freeze

//JS uses asynchronous programming -  it can let slow tasks run in the background 
//		while rest of the code can continue
